# [üî¥ SALAMA] - Safety Assurance with Live AI Monitoring & Alerts üö¶ü§ñ

> **üöß Development Status**: This is an early-stage prototype, and the code is not guaranteed to work as intended in all scenarios. Currently, the functionality is limited to adding a camera, utilizing the **Camera Prompt** feature, and performing one detection cycle using YOLO11 and LLaMA 3.2 Vision models. Additional features and capabilities are under active development. üõ†Ô∏è Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve the project! üöÄ

## üöÄ Introduction

In the realm of railway safety, the need for intelligent, real-time monitoring systems is paramount. Traditional surveillance often relies on manual oversight, leading to delayed responses and human error. SALAMA addresses these challenges by integrating state-of-the-art AI technologies to create a proactive safety net.

### The Vision

Imagine a surveillance system capable of instantaneously detecting potential hazards and making context-aware decisions to prevent incidents. By harnessing the swift object detection capabilities of **YOLO11** and the sophisticated visual reasoning of **LLaMA 3.2 Vision**, SALAMA sets a new standard for intelligent monitoring systems.

### How SALAMA Transforms Surveillance

- **YOLO11** provides lightning-fast object detection, processing video feeds at **100 FPS** to identify people, objects, and potential hazards in real-time.
- **LLaMA 3.2 Vision** offers advanced contextual analysis, interpreting detections within their environment to trigger intelligent actions and reduce false positives.
- The synergy of these technologies enables SALAMA to deliver proactive alerts, ensuring safety operators can respond swiftly to emerging risks.
